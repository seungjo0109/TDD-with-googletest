## Test Driven Development (TDD) in C++ with Googletest and Googlemock

### Types of test
* Unit test
    * verifies the basic building blocks of the software.
* Integration test 
    * verifies the combined funcitonality of all the modules put together.
    * modules can be called modules, individual apps if your app communicates with another app.
* System test
    * end to end test of the entire application workflow, where all the specifications and all the requirements of the app or tested.
    * this is a form of black box testing, meaning that you do not have access to the code.
* All of these things fall into the category of functional testing because they test if the software works correctly.

* Ohter types of tests include stress and load testing, which can test your software in extreme conditions.
* Accpetance testing is there a software user friendly or not, and so on.
